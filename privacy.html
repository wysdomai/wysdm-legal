  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Wysdom AI (“we,” “our,” “the App”) provides AI-powered study tools that process user-submitted

    and safeguarded when you use the App.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collected</h2>

    <li>Authentication information (Apple or Google sign-in, email)</li>
    <li>User-submitted documents, images, and study materials</li>

  <h2>Processing of Submitted Materials</h2>
  <p>
    User-submitted documents and images are transmitted to external automated processing
    systems for the purpose of text extraction, analysis, transformation, and generation of
    study content. These systems may utilize machine learning technologies to improve the
    quality, accuracy, and performance of document interpretation and content generation.
  </p>

  <p>
    By using the App, you acknowledge and consent to this processing, which may occur on

    parsing, text extraction, and AI-driven content generation. Submitted materials and
    derived text may be processed by these providers as necessary to deliver the App’s
    functionality.
  </p>

  <p>
    Wysdom AI does not sell user data. However, data processed by third-party systems is
    subject to their respective data handling practices.
